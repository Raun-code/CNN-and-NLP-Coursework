# 🧠 AI Coursework Repository – CNN Presentation & NLP Project

This repository contains two major components of MSc Data Science coursework:

* 📽️ A **presentation on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
* 📘 A **Natural Language Processing (NLP) application and report**

Both components demonstrate the integration of machine learning theory with practical implementation using real-world datasets and scholarly research.

  * Sourced from the university library
  * Described research goals, dataset, CNN design, and results
* **4. Why CNN?**

  * Justification of CNN for visual/spatial pattern recognition tasks
* **5. Visualisations**

  * CNN architecture diagram
  * Visual outputs from the paper (e.g. confusion matrix, sample predictions)
* **6. Personal Reflection**

  * Brief commentary on hands-on CNN implementation in lab (e.g. MNIST digit recognition)
